            <p>

                If you're involved in an accident that causes damage to someone else's property or injury to another person, your insurance can cover the costs associated with legal liabilities and medical expenses.
            </p>
            <h5>4. Coverage for Vehicle Damage:   </h5>
            <p>
                Depending on the policy type, motor insurance can cover the repair costs for damage to your own vehicle, whether due to an accident, theft, or natural disasters.

            </p>
            <h5>5. CPersonal Accident Coverage:   </h5>
            <p>
                Many motor insurance policies include coverage for medical expenses and compensation for injuries sustained by the policyholder and passengers in the insured vehicle.

            <h5>6. Optional Add-Ons:  </h5>
            <p>

                This policy provides coverage for damages to your vehicle, third-party liabilities, theft, vandalism, natural disasters, and more. It offers a higher level of protection.
            </p>
            <h5>3.Third-Party, Fire, and Theft Insurance:</h5>
            <p>
                This policy includes coverage for damages to third parties, as well as protection against fire and theft for your own vehicle.
            </p>
            <h5>4.Add-Ons and Riders:  </h5>
            <p>
